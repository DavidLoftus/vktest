This was done every other day during a week on Holidays when I only had a Mac to use. I used CMake, GLFW and Vulkan ofcourse. I used vscode IDE, mainly because it was already installed but the extensions made it almost the same as Visual Studio. It was also a good experience in working with cmake and git, they were quite easy to use after initial setup.
I first only wanted to mess with Compute but it got boring messing with moving particles without being able to see anything. I added alot but in order to quickly write this I didn't make any generalisations for different physical devices, aka it will only work on this Mac (for now?)
